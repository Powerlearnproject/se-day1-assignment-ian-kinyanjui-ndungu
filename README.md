Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of engineering methods, tools and principlesin the development and maintenance of high quality software systems
Importance of Software engineering in technology industry:
it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of our ,modern life ie comunication entertainment healthcare and commerce



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programmin languages ie fotran
establishment of software engineering as a principle
the advent of structured programming
the rise of agile methdologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documenting of both user and system requirements 
Design: creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to design specifications
Testing : Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets qualitystandards and functional requirements
Deployment: Release of softare to end users
Maintenance : providing ongoing support , updates and enhancements to software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is stuctured and consequential whereas agile methodology is iterative and incremental emphasizing flexibility, collaboration and continuos development
waterfall methodology is upfront and detailed while agile methodology is adaptive and flexible
waterfall methodology is limited while agile methodology is continuos and incorporated
Waterfall methodology is manged upfront while agile methodolgy is managed throughout the whole project

when dealing with projects with clearly defined permanent requirements, large scale projects with complex dependencies we use waterfall methodology whereas with projects with
evolving requirements and those that require flexibility and adaptability to change we use the agile methodology 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing tests plans
Project manager:oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments provide tools for debugging and testing code ie Falcon, Visual studio, Eclipse.
Version Control systems: help to track changes to source code and coordination of work among team members they include Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Evolving requirements, tight deadline and technical debt to overcoe this challenges we use the following strategies effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:Involves testing individual components or modules of Software helps to improve code quality and maintainability
Integration testing: Tests the interactions between different components or subsystems ensuring that components integrate seamlessly and function as expected when combined.
System testing: Tests the  entire software system as a whole identifying defects that may only emerge when the system is tested as a whole.
Acceptance testing: tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the crafting of questions or instructions in a way that gets you the best responses from your AI
when interacting with Ai prompt engineering ensures that the AI provides accurate answers and the creativity of the AI can be measured.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt : describe the behaviour of wild carnivores
Improved Prompt: describe the behavior of a lion in he wild its shelter, behaviour, eating habits and means of survival
By providing a clear, specific, and concise prompt, the AI model generates a more focused and informative response to the prompt.
